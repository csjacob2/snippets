**_A rudimentary on-screen loading/timer widget that takes assorted variables as inputs and displays a growing bar as time counts_**

**Solution summary:** Takes two parameters, `milliseconds` (the number of milliseconds to run), `width` (width of the bar), with some built-in limitations (in the HTML5 `input` tags but can be overridden) and generates a red progress bar.

**ES6:** Uses arrow functions and recursion.
