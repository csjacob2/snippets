    <p><i>Brute-force a list of hashes to find the passwords</i></p>

    <p>We have provided 10 different hashes in the hashed_passwords array. All the passwords in the array were taken from Mark Burnett's "10,000 Top Passwords" list. Find the passwords behind these hashes. The algorithm to hash the passwords is MD5. From top to bottom the strength of the password grows, for example:<br/>
        1. First 5 hashes are straight from the list.<br/>
        2. Next four are combinations. For example: Jack1 or JackJack<br/>
        3. Last one is made out of the same list except one character in the password is different. For example: J@ck or Ja3k.</p>

    <p><i><b>Combination</b></i> is using a heavily modified pared down JSON file for demonstration purposes as the 10,000 word file runs too slowly. The modified file does contain the values in it to find the correct answers.</p>
