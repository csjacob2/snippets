    <p><b>Decrypting AES</b></p>

    <p><i>aes_key.hex contains a 256-bit AES key represented as a series of hexadecimal values. aes_iv.hex contains a 128-bit Initialization Vector in a similar representation. We encrypted a Jeopardy clue using AES in CBC mode with this key and IV and wrote the resulting ciphertext (also stored in hexadecimal) in aes_ciphertext.hex.</i></p>

    <p><i>Decrypt the ciphertext.</i></p>

    <p><i>Note: the decryption is cut off as the assigned ciphertext was actually cut off as well (unintentionally).</i></p>
