# Cryptography
**_A range of cryptography questions and solutions using the CryptoJS library for security class assignments._**

1. Decrypt AES (`decrypt_aes.html`): Decrypt a ciphertext when given the 128-bit Initialization Vector and a 256-bit key.
2. Break a Weak AES Key (`breaking_aes.html`): Break a ciphertext when not supplied with the encryption key but given the hint that it is 256 bits long with the 251 leftmost bits are all 0s and the Initialization Vector set to 0.
